main.py - trains or loads a model and evaluates it by accuracy and loss of each iteration
visualize_preformance.py - a class of functions for generating various matplotlib plots to evaluate  model performance
advarsarial.py - creates and shows advarsarial examples for the model


############### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS ###############

To measure model performance, one must load it by changing PATH_TO_LOAD to the desired path and define is_trained = False
Otherwise, the code will train a model based on training set. One must provide a PATH_TO_SAVE and define is_trained = True
All hyperparameters can be defined (epochs, lr, batch_size)
The code will print the current accuracy and loss of each epoch

To generate and advarsarial example one must provide to the function generate_adversarial a path to a trained model.

The script in "main.py" collects lists of accuracy and loss value per epoch, those can be provided to the functions
in "visualize_performance.py" to create plots.
